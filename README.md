# Training Project: COBOL â†’ Java Maven Application Migration

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **step-by-step migration** of a sample COBOL program that uses the `JSON GENERATE` statement into an equivalent **Java Maven application**.  

- **Initial state:** a COBOL program using the GnuCOBOL `JSON GENERATE` extension to transform internal data structures into JSON format.  
- **Final state:** a Java Maven application with support for reading CSV files, flexible output options, and comprehensive testing.  

The project evolves through a sequence of incremental improvements.  
Each stage is documented as a separate **Issue** with its own Main.java and README.md.  
This document provides a consolidated summary of all stages.

---

## Issue 1: Analysis of the Existing COBOL Project

### Summary
- The COBOL program is a **proof of concept** showcasing JSON generation from internal structures using `JSON GENERATE`.  
- It operates only on **hard-coded data**, without external files or user input.  
- Main goal: to capture the original functionality for further migration into Java.

---

## Issue 2: Initial COBOL â†’ Java Conversion

### Summary
- A **literal translation** of COBOL algorithms and structures into a Java application (`my_first_migration`).  
- Purpose: demonstrate direct equivalence without optimization or architectural improvements.
- This Issue is a standalone Java project.
---

## Issue 3: Code Quality Improvements and Refactoring for Dynamic Data

### Overview
- Migrated to a Maven project (`my-first-migration`).  
- Added unit tests with **JUnit 5**.  
- Performed refactoring: `WsRecord` extracted into a standalone structure, with clearer method names.  
- Enhanced error handling and input validation.  
- Main class renamed from `JsonGenerateExample` to `Main`.
- This Issue is a standalone Java Maven project.

**Outcome:** The project became structured, extensible, and testable.

## Issue 4: Code Quality Enhancements and Feature Additions

### Final Project Summary
**Goal:** Add enterprise-level functionality and improve architecture.

### New Features
- **CSV input support** â†’ batch data processing.  
- **File output** â†’ `-o` option for saving results.  
- **Extended data fields** â†’ timestamp, description.  
- **Pretty JSON** â†’ human-readable formatting.  
- **Encapsulation** â†’ private fields with getters/setters.
- This Issue is a standalone Java Maven project.
