# Issue 3: Improve Code Quality and Refactor for Dynamic Data

## Comparative Analysis of `my_first_migration` and `my-first-migration`

### 1. General Overview
The application converts input parameters into JSON format with validation and error handling.
As part of the *Improve Code Quality and Refactor for Dynamic Data* task, the project was migrated from a simple “flat” Java project (`my_first_migration`) to a fully-fledged Maven project (`my-first-migration`).  
The main goal was to improve the structure, increase code quality through refactoring, add automated testing, and implement more reliable error handling.
Input data: Command line arguments when starting the application.
Output data: JSON document in the console.

### 2. Characteristics of the Original Project `my_first_migration`
- **File Structure**: a single file `JsonGenerateExample.java`.
- **Classes**: only `JsonGenerateExample` (with an inner class `WsRecord`).
- **Functionality**:
  - Simulates COBOL’s `JSON GENERATE` operator.
  - Manual JSON string generation.
  - Minimal error handling.
- **Limitations**:
  - No testing.
  - No build system (manual compilation only).
  - Weak error diagnostics.
  - All functionality tightly coupled into a single class.

### 3. Characteristics of the Improved Project `my-first-migration`
- **File Structure**:
  - `Main.java` — the main application class.
  - `MainTest.java` — unit test suite.
  - `pom.xml` — Maven configuration.
- **Key Improvements**:
  1. **Migration to Maven**  
     - The project became Maven-based.  
     - Automatic compilation, dependency management, and test execution via `mvn test`.
  2. **Added Tests**  
     - Implemented `MainTest` class using JUnit 5.  
     - Covered key scenarios: flag setting, JSON correctness, argument handling, exceptional cases.
  3. **Code Refactoring**  
     - `WsRecord` refactored as an inner structure inside `Main`.  
     - Introduced `createWsRecordFromArgs` for flexible and validated initialization.  
     - Added `padToLength` for correct string length handling.
  4. **Improved Error Handling**  
     - Explicit input validation.  
     - Exception handling: `IllegalArgumentException`, `NullPointerException`, `Exception`.  
     - Detailed error messages + proper program termination.
  5. **Class Renaming**  
     - `JsonGenerateExample` → `Main` (aligns with standard project structures).  
     - More readable method and variable names.

| Characteristic                 | `my_first_migration`                 | `my-first-migration`                         |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Project Structure              | Single Java file                     | Maven project (src/main/java, src/test/java) |
| Main Class                     | JsonGenerateExample                  | Main                                          |
| Test Support                   | No                                   | Yes, JUnit 5                                  |
| Error Handling                 | Basic try/catch                      | Detailed validation and diagnostics           |
| Dependency Management          | None                                 | Maven (pom.xml)                               |
| Code Quality & Readability     | Low, monolithic class                | High, refactored and modularized              |
| Compatibility & Portability    | Manual compilation and execution     | Maven build/test, CI/CD integration           |

### 5. Performance Comparison
Both applications demonstrate similar performance since the core JSON generation logic remained unchanged.  
The main advantages of the Maven version are:
- Better maintainability.
- Automated testing capabilities.
- Simplified build and deployment process.

---

### 6. How to Build and Run
For **my-first-migration** (Maven version):

**Build the project:**
```bash
mvn clean compile
````

**Run with default values:**

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="my.first.migration.Main"
```

**Run with command-line arguments:**

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="my.first.migration.Main" -Dexec.args="John Doe true"
```

**Other examples:**

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="my.first.migration.Main" -Dexec.args="John Doe true"
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="my.first.migration.Main" -Dexec.args="Alise Smith false"
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="my.first.migration.Main" -Dexec.args="Test 12345 true"
```

**Run tests:**

```bash
mvn test
```

**Create an executable JAR:**

```bash
mvn package
```

**Run the JAR file:**

```bash
java -jar target/my-first-migration-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

**Run the JAR file with arguments:**

```bash
java -jar target/my-first-migration-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar John Doe true
```

---

### 7. Conclusions

* The `my-first-migration` project became more **structured, extensible, and maintainable**.
* **Tests** were added, ensuring reliability and preventing regressions.
* Maven simplified dependency management and integration with automation tools.
* The codebase now aligns with **industry-standard practices** for Java application development.

Thus, the *Improve Code Quality and Refactor for Dynamic Data* task has been successfully completed: the project evolved from a minimal demo implementation into a full-fledged Maven project with tests and an improved architecture.
