# Issue 2: Initial Conversion COBOL ‚Üí Java

## Project Description

This project demonstrates an initial, "na√Øve" approach to converting a simple COBOL program that uses JSON GENERATE into equivalent Java code.  
The goal is not to build a perfect Java architecture, but to illustrate the direct transfer of logic and data structures.

## üìã Original COBOL Code (`json-generate.cbl`)

The COBOL program creates a JSON document from the `ws-record` using the `JSON GENERATE` statement and performs the following steps:

- Declares working variables (`ws-json-output`, `ws-json-char-count`)
- Defines the record `ws-record` with the following fields:
  - `ws-record-name` ‚Äî name, 10 characters
  - `ws-record-value` ‚Äî value, 10 characters
  - `ws-record-blank` ‚Äî blank field, 10 characters
  - `ws-record-flag` ‚Äî flag (5 characters) with level-88 conditions (enabled/disabled)
- Populates the fields using `MOVE` and `SET` statements
- Outputs the result using `DISPLAY` statements

## üîÑ Converted Java Code

A direct, literal translation of the COBOL code into Java. The same steps are reproduced:

- Working variables `wsJsonOutput` and `wsJsonCharCount`
- A `WsRecord` class to describe the record structure with fields `name`, `value`, `blank`, `flag`
- Methods `setFlagEnabled()` and `setFlagDisabled()` reproduce COBOL's level-88 conditions
- `MOVE` and `SET` statements are replaced by direct assignments
- The `JSON GENERATE` statement is manually implemented using `String.format(...)`
- `DISPLAY` statements are replaced by `System.out.println(...)`
- To match COBOL output, the character count is printed with leading zeros (`%04d`)

## üîë Key Conversion Decisions

### 1. Fixed-length COBOL fields ‚Üí Java strings
In COBOL, strings have a fixed length (e.g., `pic x(10)`). In Java, this limitation does not exist, so spaces are added manually and then trimmed using `.trim()`.

### 2. Level-88 conditions ‚Üí class methods
COBOL defines boolean-like conditions with 88. In Java, this logic is implemented with explicit methods (`setFlagEnabled()` and `setFlagDisabled()`).

### 3. JSON GENERATE ‚Üí manual JSON construction
Since Java has no built-in equivalent, JSON is constructed manually with `String.format`. This is a simplified version, without external libraries such as Jackson or Gson.

### 4. DISPLAY ‚Üí console output
COBOL sequentially prints fields and strings. In Java, this is implemented with `System.out.println` and `System.out.printf`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Simplifications

- JSON generation is done manually, without third-party libraries
- Fixed-length field behavior is emulated with padding, which is not idiomatic in Java
- Exception handling (`on exception`) is simplified to a try/catch block with program termination
- The code is a demonstration of conversion and is not intended for production use

## üöÄ How to Run

### COBOL
1. Install [GnuCOBOL](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/)
2. Ensure JSON support was enabled during build (`--with-json`)
3. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   cobc -x json-generate.cbl
   ./json-generate
### Java
Save the file JsonGenerateExample.java under the folder my_first_migration/

Compile:

bash
javac my_first_migration/JsonGenerateExample.java
Run:

bash
java my_first_migration.JsonGenerateExample

##üí° Conclusion
This example clearly illustrates that initial conversion often involves directly transferring the algorithm into the target language with maximum preservation of the original structure.
Such an approach quickly produces a working prototype, which should later be refactored and improved to align with the idioms and best practices of the target language (Java).
